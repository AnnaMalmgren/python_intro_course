# python_intro_course
Introductory course for python, which includes expressing mathematical algorithms in Python, data types and structures,   
structuring and organising Python code, use of Python libraries, basic data analysis of large files.    

## Lab 1 - Text analysis  
A program that reads documents, and performs frequency analysis of the occurences of words.    
The analysis consists of calculating the frequency of the words in given documents and cosine similarity between given text documents.     


## Lab 2 - Graphics and animation    
A simple game where you can shoot projectiles/cannon balls at different angles and speed.    
The animation shows two cannons, one to the left and the other to the right, the trajectories of the projectiles and where they land.     
The aim of the game is to configure the angle of the cannon so that the cannon ball hits the cannon on the opposite side.     


## Lab 3 - Machine Learning
Implements linear regression using native python code, and polynomial regression using numpy. 
The results are plotted using matplotlib.pyplot.
